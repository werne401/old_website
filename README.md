## About me
First, thank you for visiting my online portfolio. My name is Lee Werner, and I am an aspiring data scientist. As a lifelong devotee
of strategy games and puzzles, I have always harbored a love and passion for discovering patterns amidst complicated and dynamic settings. 
When I discovered the field of data science, I knew I had found a career path that I could be passionate about forever.
From my work experience, independent learning efforts, and formal education, I have discovered the knowledge base and toolsets that
data scientists require for their work is immense, and requires an incredible amount of work to become skilled in the field. Thankfully,
I love challenges, and while I have spent many long nights staring down my code and asking why it doesn't work, I have never lost an
ounce of the excitement and passion that originally led me down this path. That passion has led me to become involved in many
fascinating projects, and the purpose of this online portfolio is to showcase to you that passion.
I hope you enjoy the show.
Lee.
