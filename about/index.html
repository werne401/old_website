<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> First, thank you for visiting my online portfolio. My name is Lee Werner, and I work in data science and statistical analytics. </p>
		
<p> As a lifelong devotee of strategy games and puzzles, I have always harbored a love and passion for discovering patterns 
amidst complicated dynamic environments. When I first discovered the field of data science, I knew I had found a career path 
that I could be passionate about forever. </p>
  
<p> From my work experience, independent learning efforts, and formal education, I have discovered the knowledge base and toolsets that
data scientists require for their work is immense, and requires an incredible amount of work to become skilled in the field. Thankfully,
I love challenges, and while I have spent many long nights staring down my code and asking why it doesn't work, I have never lost an
ounce of the excitement and passion that originally led me down this path. </p>

<p> That passion has led me to become involved in many fascinating projects, and the purpose of this online portfolio 
	is to showcase to you that passion.</p>

<p> Enjoy my site! </p>

<p> Cheers, </p>

<p> Lee. </p>
